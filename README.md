# misc-projects
These are miscellaneous projects that I have completed throughout my coursework at the University of Mount Union that I personally found notable. Programs that will exist here will usually be .ipynb or .R files.

If there are any issues regarding the program posted or any questions, please email me tomterziu@gmail.com
